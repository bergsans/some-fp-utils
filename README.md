# TypeScript functional programming utilities


Currently, I am brushing up on some TypeScript, and I've implemented a set of
functions used in functional programming for practice. They are perhaps of
interest to someone else, someone learning about functional programming or wanting to
use it with TypeScript. Each definition includes a test case written with
Jest demonstrating the feature. For all definitions I've aimed for clarity,
not performance.
